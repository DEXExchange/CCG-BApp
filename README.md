Project Details:
Crypto Cannabis Grow Dapp tracks and ledgers dynamic growth of licensed real cannabis on to the Tron Blockchain. Each real plant being grown is ledgered via a digital one with a smart contract logic system in place to read and determine the time of growth. When growth cycles complete the CCG DApp tracks and batches plants ready for harvest apart from plants still in growth cycle. A great win for the dispensaries is to save on costs with the current seed to sale ledger systems in place that carry annual licensing costs. With Crypto Cannabis Grow, the dapp is free of monthly or annual base fee costs standard for current seed to sale tracking products. Being free for all dispensaries to utility is enabled via the ability to freeze TRX for added energy for free contract trigger costs instead of costing Tron TRX directly. Also freezing TRX for bandwidth towards free transactions among licensed dispensaries and also receiving Tron block rewards for voting for network delegates with frozen Tron is a great incentive for businesses. So not only is CCG ledgering system product also free, but can help accrue new TRX rewards to the dispensaries wallets all with free/very low cost transactions.][Video Demo Instructions: https://youtu.be/S2vIxTmhvbI.
